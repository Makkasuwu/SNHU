How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing clear and concise commented code is one way I go about programming. In doing so, just like the crud module I can use these methods in the future for other projects like a personal website.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

There was a lot of research needed for this course, i'm not too familiar with mongo db or writing in python. Google was a good source of knowledge on how to connect different parts for the project.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists do a lot of research and testing to accomplish desired technology to benefit and make every day tasks easier for society.
