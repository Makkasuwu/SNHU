CS-230 Operating Platforms

The gaming room wanted me to create a web based version of their game draw it or lose it. They wanted this game to be available on all devices as it was limited to android.
I believe, I looked into the advantages and disadvantages really well of each operating system. Working while documenting made the code a bit easier, as it was more concise 
of what the clients expectations where.I think I would revise the reccommendations a bit more, looking back I think there was a bit more I could reccommend. It's important 
to consider the users needs when designing, if you don't it could be more work down the line. Or you may end up with frustrated users as well.I really liked the work flow graphs, 
it really helped line out the process for what the client wants on top of gets you thinking of how to go about programming a feature.
