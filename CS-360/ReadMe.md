Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I was to create a weight loss application that stored users weight and information

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I had to create a system that displayed users information, users weight tracking on a graph, and then the users weight goal.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

A lot of the UI based steps were beneficial for me to learn especialy color coding for a sleek design.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I would debug my code religiously to verify there were no issues when running the app.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
 A lot of my inovation came from the design itself, I wanted it to stand out compared to other clunky applications I had seen.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe my code looks great and functional as it's easy to read and you can understand the flow I took.
