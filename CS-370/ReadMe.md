The code that I modified for this project was the Q Deep learning algorithm that was used to create an AI to solve a treasure hunter game.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

Usually with Google, to verify you're not reinventing the wheel or using "innovation" the more fun tasks are "exploration" where you are inventing the wheel.
