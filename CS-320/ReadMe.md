For CS-320 we were tasked with creating three projects in which to learn automated test's including Junit testing with. For our final project, project 2 we then created a self reflection of our work and what we had learned when doing each of these projects and what our overall thoughts were when finishing. The final reflection will be done in this readme to answer three questions we were given.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

This can be done via tests, both on the development and QA side. Like previously stated, we just learned about automated testing which could also be used even on checking of code.

How do i interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Static testing would be the best approach, as you groom the ticket to see what the client wants. What the specs are of the project and what all may be needed.

How do I approach designing software?

Static testing here is great as well, finding what the user wants, what your requirements are and what all is needed is the first step to designing software.
Then you need to find what limits you want to put in place, so that the end user can't do. We did this in our projects by verifying the end user wasn't able to input data into fields that wouldn't make sense.
