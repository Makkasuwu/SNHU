CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle

In this course we learned about the full development lifecycle software goes through. In doing so, we learned about how each person has certain jobs they must do 
and the importance of working together. In my final project, we were asked to submit a final retro on everything we've learned when role playing as each member of a scrum team.
