How do I approach designing software?

First I look at what is needed for the project, what the "issue" i'm trying to solve is and then research the best way to go about solving that issue.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Researching and how to go about testing.

Researching was a huge part of this project, since i'm really green to OpenGL and design in general this project  had me watching several videos and documentation
on how to implementing my objects.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This could benefit my current job as to keep pushing and do research, don't be afraid to take tasks that may seem out of reach. The documentation is out there.

How do I approach developing programs?
Testing and lots of research.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
A lot of strategies just involved trial and error, when something didnt look right, it was constantly running the program to get my shapes to look ok

How did iteration factor into your development?
Constant tests on seeing if everything lined up.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach helped a lot  as the more projects I undertook for the course, the more i understood on what I had to do and edit.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help society in general, not just my goals as you can use this knowledge to make your everyday life easier.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This course helps prepare me for more advanced courses down the road.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
This course will be able to assist me if I want to get into design or video game design down the road. For my current job, it unfortunately won't help.
