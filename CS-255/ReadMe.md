Liam was the CEO of DriverPass he wanted us to create a web based application that could be used for anyone to obtain knowledge on driving tests and schedule their driving exams. I believe my diagrams give a nice and elegant flow on how each method works. If I were to revise one thing, I think I would add more details into my business requirements. As for the user's needs, it's very important to consider them when developing the design. This is because these are the main things the user wants, and must be included in the project. It's easier to build a project around ideals instead of building the project then thinking of the wants.
