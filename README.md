Classwork
This project was our first assignment where we had to do some extensive coding to solve a real world problem. In doing so, we created a interest calculator.

What I think I did well was my naming conventions and writing solid clean code.

If I could change one thing, I think I could do better in my commenting. it's a bit lacking and makes it a little confusing if someone were to make changes.

This project was a nice challenge, and did stump me on a few parts. However, thankfully to stack overflow and google I was able to get around it fairly easily.

One thing to take from this project could be better commenting, following clean readable code, and a good insight to what a project on the outside world could be like.

A way I tried to make it easily readable is by creating understandable naming conventions, though my comments were lacking I think you could get the jist idea of what's going on. On top of clear and concise spacing making the code easier to read.

CS-230 Operating Platforms

The gaming room wanted me to create a web based version of their game draw it or lose it. They wanted this game to be available on all devices as it was limited to android.

I believe, I looked into the advantages and disadvantages really well of each operating system.

Working while documenting made the code a bit easier, as it was more concise of what the clients expectations where.

I think I would revise the reccommendations a bit more, looking back I think there was a bit more I could reccommend.

It's important to consider the users needs when designing, if you don't it could be more work down the line. Or you may end up with frustrated users as well.

I really liked the work flow graphs, it really helped line out the process for what the client wants on top of gets you thinking of how to go about programming a feature.
