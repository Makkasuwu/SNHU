This project was our first assignment where we had to do some extensive coding to solve a real world problem. In doing so, we created a interest calculator.

What I think I did well was my naming conventions and writing solid clean code.

If I could change one thing, I think I could do better in my commenting. it's a bit lacking and makes it a little confusing if someone were to make changes.

This project was a nice challenge, and did stump me on a few parts. However, thankfully to stack overflow and google I was able to get around it fairly easily.

One thing to take from this project could be better commenting, following clean readable code, and a good insight to what a project on the outside world could be like.

A way I tried to make it easily readable is by creating understandable naming conventions, though my comments were lacking I think you could get the jist idea of what's going on. On top of clear and concise spacing making the code easier to read.
